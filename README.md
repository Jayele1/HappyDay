### Happy Day

This is a fun project to show what Automated Tests are like and also to show what I look for in a Happy Day!



### Install

1. [Install TestCafe ] (https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/installing-testcafe.html)


### How to Run

From the root folder run this command

    ```
    testcafe chrome tests/happyDayTest.js --speed 0.5
    ```

    - the ```--speed 0.5``` is to slow down the test to see what is going on :)
    - Make sure audio is on as well for the music!
