### Happy Day

This is a fun project to test if Today is going to be a good day!

This project is Javascript based, using the testing tool TestCafe


### Setup

1. Install TestCafe https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/installing-testcafe.html


2. Clone or download this repo to your computer 


3. Make sure you have Chrome installed on your machine


### How to Run

https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/getting-started/#running-the-test

From the root folder of the project run this command

    testcafe chrome tests/happyDayTest.js --speed 0.5
    

    - the '--speed 0.5' is to slow down the test to see what is going on :)
